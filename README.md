#Programming Kotlin
This is the code repository for [Programming Kotlin](https://www.packtpub.com/application-development/programming-kotlin?utm_source=GitHub&utm_medium=repository&utm_campaign=9781787126367), published by Packt. It contains all the supporting project files necessary to work through the book from start to finish.
##Instructions and Navigations
All of the code is organized into folders. Each folder starts with a number followed by the application name. For example, Chapter02.

The code will look like the following:
```
public Sensor(String id, double value) { 
  this.id = id;
  this.value = value; 
}
```
You will need a good understanding of R or another programming language. Preliminary experience of programming and data analysis will be helpful as well. You will need to appreciate algorithms that can be applied in scale to build applications.

With the following software and hardware list you can run all code files present in the book (Chapter 1-13)
